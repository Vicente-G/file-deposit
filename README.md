# file-deposit

This repo work as a file deposit to retrieve from myself any image or any other kind of file to use it via HTTP request. It may be used for a variety of purposes, feel free to use any of these files as yours by copying the following url an using it on markdown or anything like it. Because I mostly will be using these files from a jupyter notebook, I'll introduce it in markdown format. Happy coding!
```md
[url link]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vicente-G/file-deposit/main/FILENAME.extension")

OR

![caption]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vicente-G/file-deposit/main/FILENAME.extension")
```
Just in case, you MUST replace FILENAME.extension for whatever file you are using from this repo.
